Some people say Superman 64 is the worst video game ever made, but why trust them? One brave man is doing the YouTube equivalent of flying faster than a speeding bullet. He's playing the game for us to watch.

"It's one of those so-bad-it's-good games," YouTube user ProtonJonSA says of the 1999 Nintendo 64 disaster, before showing us... oh, man... glitches in the game's canned playthrough that the developers thought would get us excited about the game, a terrible storyline synopsis screen, a wretched training level. And it gets worse and worse.

And that's just part 1.

It gets worse and worse.

ProtonJon has uploaded a bunch of playthrough videos, so you can watch level after level of the game. Eventually you get to the level 4 playthrough, which features an interview with the game's producer.



Through that interview we learn that Superman 64 might have sucked because the people who own the Superman franchise were hard to work with. Choice quotes:

Where did the idea of Superman going into a virtual world to save his friends come from?

Eric: Political reasons, as the licensor refused to let Superman kick "real" peopleâ€¦
and

Jon: Did Superman 64 turn out to be near what your team had envisioned at the start, or was the finished product sidetracked by hardware or other limitations?

Eric: Of course not. It is not even 10% of what we intended to do, but the licensor killed us!
Ouch. Watch the videos and cringe. Superman 64 is bad. I bought it recently and couldn't play past the first level. Terrible, terrible game. And now you can see the proof or relive the horror. Be careful.
